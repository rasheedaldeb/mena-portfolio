          I’m a Software Engineer and UI/UX Designer specialized in building
          intuitive, scalable digital products. I combine strong technical
          skills in mobile development (Flutter) with user-centered design
          thinking to create experiences that are both functional and visually
          refined. I enjoy transforming complex ideas into clear systems, clean
          interfaces, and efficient workflows. My focus is not just on how
          things look — but on how they work, scale, and deliver real value. I’m
          constantly learning, improving, and pushing my standards higher with
          every project I build.
